# What's the concept?

A few paragraphs on the game concept

# How does it work?

A brief overview of how the game works but not reproduction of rules. Enough to give someone a flavour of how it works.

# What do I need to get started?

A list of the minimum stuff required to play the base version of the game. Links to an SRD or basic rules, if they exist, is appreciated.

## How much will that cost?

An approximate price for the minimum rules and tools required.
