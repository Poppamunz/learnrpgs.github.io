# What's the concept?

You are mighty heroes travelling on a ship to various Greek inspired islands. 

A group of heroes play through an island described to them by the Strife player. They may win or they may lose, they may need to call on the gods to aid them but whatever happens they will leave the islands changed from when they found them.

The game doesn't need to be based on the Greek pantheon of gods and the core rulebook gives informaton on how to switch the pantheon out for others. 

# How does it work?

The Heroes (the players) consult the gods for signs before they approach an island that is described by the Strife player (the player who runs the game). 

The Heroes' arrival involves an encounter that brings them onto the island and sets the scene. They then proceed to go through a number of trials as they try to solve the issues present on the island.

After they have completed their trials they must face a final battle for the fate of the island. The battle will threatens the characters and locations they have met during the trials.

After the outcome of the battle the characters head back to sea to recuperate, tell tales of their exploits and seek out a new island...

## How much will that cost?

The rulebook is available for $25 (hardcover with bonus pdf)/$15 (digital). Getting a full set of dice will be easier with
